title: Me and Python
---


Python has many different uses so I've learned. It's used to make websites and software and is widely used for database. The positives of using python is that it is beginner friendly and is considered a general use language. It's considered a versatile language with easy syntax. The downsides of python for me would probably have to be the strict use of indentation. It could be helpful in the fact that it helps you be mindful of indenting, but it can be frustrating.
